# automation-service

automation-service is a tool for setting up simple-to-complicated automations. It communicates via MQTT and can automatically pull and use device and group information from Zigbee2MQTT, but it can be used with anything that can communicate over MQTT. It provides a simple message protocol for starting, stopping, and scheduling automations. It provides the ability to script your automations in Lua with batteries-included helpers, or build them in Haskell for more complex or "infrastructural" requirements.

Right now this software is usable, but in a very alpha state. See [TODO](#todo) below.

## How It Works

Currently it is assumed you will be running automation-service in a container setup [as described below](#running).

In the root directory of your automation-service install (as configured in docker-compose), in the same location as the config.dhall file, place a lua-automations directory--the easy way to set all of this up is to simply clone/copy the repo into place and tweak.

Any Lua scripts in the lua-automations directory will be available for running. Here is a basic example which flashes lights when a sensor is triggered and a specific condition is met:

```lua
local frontDoorSensor
local frontDoorSensorChan
local basementMirrorLight
local livingRoomWindowLight

function setup ()
   frontDoorSensor = register("0x0015bc001e00f658")
   basementMirrorLight = register("0xb4e3f9fffe14c707")
   livingRoomWindowLight = register("0x680ae2fffe4577ac")
   frontDoorSensorChan = subscribe(frontDoorSensor.topic)
end

function loop ()
   resp = frontDoorSensorChan()

   if resp.contact == false then
      logDebugMsg("hey someone opened the door")
      publish(basementMirrorLight.topicSet, { effect = "blink" })
      publish(livingRoomWindowLight.topicSet, { effect = "blink" })
   end
end
```

You can start this by sending a "start" message to the topic "automation-service/set", e.g.:

```bash
$ mosquitto_pub -u user -p password -t automation-service/set -m "{\"start\": \"frontDoor\"}"
```

A second "start" message will kill any running instances of the automation, and start it again (setup() will be run again). Similarly, you can stop a running automation using a "stop" message:


```bash
$ mosquitto_pub -u user -p password -t automation-service/set -m "{\"stop\": \"frontDoor\"}"
```

You can schedule an automation to run with a message as well, using [cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#Overview) syntax:

```bash
$ mosquitto_pub -u user -p password -t automation-service/set \
  -m "{\"schedule\": \"0 6 * * *\", \"job\": {\"start\": \"frontDoor\"}, \"jobId\": \"frontDoorJob\"}"
```

You can unschedule automation jobs with the jobId via "unschedule:"

```bash
$ mosquitto_pub -u user -p password -t automation-service/set m "{\"unschedule\": \"frontDoorJob\"}"
```

If you use Home Assistant, you can send messages to MQTT topics via it's developer console as well. These messages and more can also be sent by scripts, so scripts can start and schedule other scripts. See an example of this in [/lua-automations/sunsetLighting.lua](lua-automations/sunsetLighting.lua).

Check out other examples in the [/lua-automations/](/lua-automations/) directory, and see the current Lua API reference documentation [here]().


## Configuration

The `mqttBroker`'s `uri` setting determines how automation-service is going to connect to the network's broker. See the default config for an example of connecting with a password via SSL. 

If you don't want to configure SSL set caCertPath, clientCertPath, and clientKeyPath to `None`.


## Running

Currently the automation-service docker image is built on every push to master and [published to the Github container registry](https://github.com/ddellacosta/automation-service/pkgs/container/automation-service). You can then run this in a docker-compose stack a la https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/linux#install-home-assistant-container:

```yaml
  automation-service:
    container_name: automation-service
    image: ghcr.io/ddellacosta/automation-service:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    networks:
      - localnet
    volumes:
      - ./automation-service/:/app
    environment:
      - TZ=America/New_York
```

You can then start this up with `docker-compose start automation-service`. Check out the automations in the `lua-automations` directory to get going. #TODO <- link here to examples


## TODO

* bug: trying to restart an automation blocks when listening on channel, have to send an interrupt message somehow
* ensure scheduled automations are re-scheduled on restart
* better error handling and logging
* more, better documentation
* add (more) HTTP client functionality to Lua API
* improvements to HA dashboard integration
  * provide users with list of run-able automations somehow
  * ability to send messages
  * links to zigbee2mqtt for devices and groups
  * general UI/UX cleanup
* provide Lua API for lighting DSL (`Service.MQTT.Messages.Lighting`)
* should be able to record a scene easily based on a given group or arbitrarily specified set of devices. This could be an automation itself which just runs listening for the command to set scenes for any given room
* auto-import scenes for devices
* profile and better understand memory usage - seems like there is a very slow memory leak
* CI build and deploy: tag build with sha vs. everything going to 'latest' (?)
* move these todos into GH issues (?)


## Development

### Building locally

This requires [nix](https://nixos.org/download.html). It is only used in one command, but makes it easy to ensure builds are consistent, including dependencies.

```bash
$ nix build; docker load < result
...
Loaded image: automation-service:78921vslcfdribi4a6wyqx1cnl0nv67x
$

```

You can now take this and drop it in your `compose.yml` file for docker-compose:


### Testing

Running tests:

```bash
# watchexec is handy:
$ watchexec -w test -w src -w app -i "*.db" -i "test/dbs/*" 'cabal test --test-show-details=always --test-options "--color=always"'
$ cabal test --test-show-details=always --test-options '--color=always -l -p Unit'
$ cabal test --test-show-details=always --test-options '--color=always -l -p Integration'
```
